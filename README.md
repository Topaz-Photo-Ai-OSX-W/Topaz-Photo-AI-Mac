## Overview

<a href="#">Topaz Photo AI</a> represents a new approach to photo enhancement where artificial intelligence handles the technical decisions traditionally requiring expertise. Rather than learning which settings work for different scenarios, users load images and receive enhanced results automatically.

The <a href="#">RAW file support</a> works with original camera files for maximum quality. Process RAW files directly without prior conversion. The AI analyzes RAW data with full bit depth available. Export enhanced images in various formats. This RAW capability ensures enhancement happens at the highest possible quality level.

<a href="#">Batch processing</a> enhances multiple images with consistent settings. Select a folder of images for automated processing. Photo AI analyzes each image individually, applying appropriate enhancement. Export processed images to specified locations. This batch capability handles shoot volumes efficiently.

The <a href="#">comparison view</a> shows original and enhanced versions side by side. Drag the divider to reveal more or less of each version. Toggle between before and after states. This comparison enables confident evaluation of enhancement results before committing to export.

<a href="#">Subject masking</a> automatically isolates primary subjects. The AI identifies people, animals, and key objects. Selective adjustments apply to subjects versus backgrounds. This automatic masking eliminates manual selection work while enabling targeted enhancement.

The <a href="#">plugin integration</a> embeds Photo AI within existing workflows. Use as a Lightroom plugin for seamless enhancement during editing. Access from Photoshop as a filter. The plugin approach means enhancement happens without leaving primary editing applications.

<a href="#">Hardware acceleration</a> leverages GPU power for responsive processing. Apple Silicon optimization ensures fast performance on M-series Macs. Preview updates happen quickly enough for iterative adjustment. Export processes efficiently regardless of resolution.

The <a href="#">model updates</a> improve enhancement quality over time. Topaz releases updated AI models as training improves. New models handle edge cases better and produce refined results. These updates mean Photo AI capabilities grow without requiring application replacement.

<a href="#">Preference presets</a> customize automatic behavior. Adjust how aggressively Autopilot applies each enhancement type. Create presets for different image types - wildlife photography might want stronger sharpening while portraits prefer subtle enhancement. These presets personalize the automatic experience.
